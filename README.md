**Phase 1: Real Estate Batch Processing**

**Introduction**
This detailed documentation presents an in-depth overview of the Real Estate Data Pipeline, a sophisticated tool designed for aggregating, transforming, and analyzing real estate data from Zillow's API. With a foundation built on Python, PySpark, and PostgreSQL, and orchestrated by Apache Airflow, this pipeline stands out for its robust data handling and storage capabilities.

**System Architecture:**

**Data Extraction (Bronze class)**
The Bronze class is responsible for interacting with the Zillow API to fetch real estate data. 

Here's a breakdown of its core functions:

**Initialization:** Sets the base directory for storing raw data, organizing it by year, month, and day to facilitate structured storage and easy 1. retrieval.
**API Interaction (getRequest):** Uses the requests library to fetch data from the Zillow API, handling pagination and ensuring complete data retrieval.
**Data Storage (extractAndSaveRawData):** Parses and saves the fetched data in JSON format, adhering to a structured file hierarchy based on the extraction date.

class Bronze:
# Initialization and directory setup
# API request handling with error management
# Iterative data fetching and storage in JSON format
    
**Data Transformation (Gold class)**
The Gold class processes the raw data using PySpark, performing various transformations to ready the data for analysis and storage:

**Schema Definition (getSchema):** Establishes a strict schema that aligns with the data fetched from Zillow, ensuring consistency and reliability in data processing.

**Data Loading and Transformation:**

Reads raw JSON data, applying the defined schema.
Extracts and cleans various components, such as addresses, and computes additional fields to enrich the data.
Normalizes data values and structures the DataFrame for efficient storage and access.

**class Gold:**
 # Schema definition for data consistency\n
 # Data loading with schema enforcement
 # Comprehensive data transformation processes
    
**Data Persistence**
Saving to Files (SaveToFiles class)
This component exports transformed data into CSV files, allowing for offline access and analysis:

**File Export:** Configures the path and format for output files, ensuring data is partitioned by property type for organized storage and quick access.
**Data Writing:** Utilizes PySpark's write capabilities to export DataFrames to CSV, maintaining header information for column definitions.
python

**class SaveToFiles:**
    # Configuration for file output
    # Partitioning and writing data to CSV format
    
**Saving to Database (SaveToDatabase class)**
Facilitates the insertion of transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, enabling complex queries and data retrieval:

**Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to PostgreSQL, utilizing credentials and connection details stored in environment variables.
Data Insertion: Determines whether to append or overwrite existing data based on the load date, then executes the data write operation to the houses table.
python

**class SaveToDatabase:**
    # Database connectivity and authentication
    # Conditional data insertion based on load date
    
**Airflow Orchestration**
Defines a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Airflow to manage and automate the pipeline's execution:

**Task Definition: **Specifies individual tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading, using Bash operators to invoke Python scripts.
Dependency Management: Establishes execution dependencies, ensuring tasks are performed in the correct sequence and data integrity is maintained.

**Phase 2: Real-Time Data Processing**

**Stream Extraction (streamingBronze class)**
The streamingBronze class is designed for real-time data extraction from the Zillow API, streaming directly into a Kafka topic. Here's how it operates:

**Producer Configuration:** Establishes a Kafka producer with necessary configurations to connect to the Kafka server and defines the topic for real estate data.

**API Interaction and Streaming:**

Retrieves real estate data from Zillow using pagination and streams each page's data into the Kafka topic in real-time.
Utilizes environment variables for API keys and handles various exceptions to ensure robust data retrieval.
python

**class streamingBronze:**
    # Kafka producer setup
    # Real-time data fetching from Zillow and streaming to Kafka topic
    
**Stream Transformation and Load (streamingGold class)**

The streamingGold class consumes the streamed data from Kafka, applies transformations, and then loads it into the PostgreSQL database, enabling real-time data analysis.

**Spark Session Initialization:** Configures a Spark session to handle streaming data, with necessary packages for Kafka integration and database connectivity.

**Data Schema and Streaming Read:**

Defines the expected schema of incoming real estate data.
Initiates a Spark streaming read from the Kafka topic, transforming the binary Kafka records into structured data.

**Data Transformation:**
Applies similar transformations as in the batch processing phase, adapting them for streaming data to ensure consistency and data quality.

**Database Insertion:**
Dynamically writes the transformed stream of data into the PostgreSQL database, with considerations for handling micro-batch outputs and checkpointing for fault tolerance.
python

**class streamingGold:**
    # Spark streaming configuration for real-time data processing
    # Schema definition and streaming read from Kafka
    # Real-time data transformation and loading to PostgreSQL
    
**Integration and Workflow**
Real-Time Data Capture: Initiates the streamingBronze class to continuously fetch and push data into the Kafka topic.
Streaming Data Processing: The streamingGold class picks up this data, transforming and loading it into the database without lag, reflecting the most current market conditions.

**User Interaction:** Users can query the up-to-date PostgreSQL database or use an integrated analytics platform to gain insights into the real estate market in real time.

**Extending the Project's Scope**
