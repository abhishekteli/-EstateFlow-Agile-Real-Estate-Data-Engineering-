#### Data Extraction (Bronze class)
Details on how the Bronze class interacts with the Zillow API to fetch real estate data, including initialization, API interaction, and data storage.

#### Data Transformation (Gold class)
Explains the data processing steps undertaken by the Gold class using PySpark, such as schema definition, data loading, and transformation.

### Data Persistence
Describes how transformed data is persisted:

#### Saving to Files (SaveToFiles class): Outlines file export configurations and data writing process.
#### Saving to Database (SaveToDatabase class): Discusses database connection and data insertion strategies.
